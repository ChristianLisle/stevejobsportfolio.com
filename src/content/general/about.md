I was born in 1955 and raised in Cupertino, California. From being a video game designer at Atari to founder of 🍎, *I think it's safe to say that I enjoy computers*.

In 1976 I helped launch [Apple](https://www.apple.com). It's a small tech company you've probably never heard of 🤭

I thought it would be nice to have a place to share all of my experiences and celebrations. Take a look around my website to get to know me 😄
